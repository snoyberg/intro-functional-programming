Introduction to functional programming
======================================

Functional programming has seen a distinct increase in interest over the past few years. Unlike the more popular
imperative and object-oriented paradigms, functional programming encourages breaking down large problems
into smaller, composable solutions, and then provides the tools to easily and safely glue these pieces together.
Said another way, functional programming delivers on the promise of creating modular code.

This is an interactive tutorial for introducing the basic principles of functional programming, using the Haskell
programming language. Since we're making such a big deal about modularity, it seems fitting that each lesson would
be provided in its own module. To get started, please click on the "HelloWorld" module in the module listing on
the left side.

By the way, you're reading this content in a full blown Haskell IDE, so at any time you can feel free to experiment
with any ideas you'd like to play with. There are no restrictions on the kinds of code you can write in this environment.

If at any point you lose this file and want to open it again, just find README.md in the file list on the left side of
the IDE.
